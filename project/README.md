This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera
course. The R script in run\_analysis.R does the following:

1.  Load the activity and feature info
2.  Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those
    columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
3.  Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges
    those columns with the dataset
4.  Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
5.  Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of
    each variable for each subject and activity pair. The end result is
    shown in the file tidy.txt.
